# 2d-Data-Visualization-of-Order-of-World-s-Happiest-Countries
This is a basic, 2d data visualization assignment I created for an Intermediate Computer Science class I took my sophmore year. When run, the program displays a series of bouncing circles that vary in their maximum bounce height. Each circle corresponds to a specific country, and the height of their bounce correlates to the "happiness index" of the country. This data is read in from a text file.

This project also includes pop-up views that appear when a user hovers over a circle (displaying information about the country it represents), as well as a searching functionality. 

This project was coded in Java using procesing.
